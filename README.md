# Movie Recommendation System
This is a Movie Recommendation System built using Flask and Python. It uses collaborative filtering and content-based filtering algorithms to recommend similar movies to users. The app allows users to select a movie from a list and get recommendations. Movie posters are fetched from The Movie Database (TMDb) API. The project structure includes the main Flask app file, Jupyter Notebook for the backend, and pickle files for storing data. The app has a user-friendly interface and is easy to use.

### How to Use
Clone the repository and unzip the similarity_movie.pkl file.

Run the Flask app with python app.py.

Select a movie and click "Recommend" to get similar movie recommendations.
